## 2024-03-24 - SQLAlchemy Index Creation on Existing Tables
**Learning:** `Base.metadata.create_all()` in SQLAlchemy does not add missing indices to tables that already exist. If Alembic (or another migration tool) is not in use, you must use raw SQL (like `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`) in the app lifecycle/startup to ensure the index is deployed to existing databases.
**Action:** Next time adding an index to an ORM model without a migration system, ensure there is a mechanism to apply that index to existing tables, such as running raw SQL during the application's lifespan setup.

## Prevention Directives for Automated Refactoring
- **Never Overwrite Complete Files**: Always use range-scoped replacement chunks (`StartLine`/`EndLine`) for edits to `schema.prisma`, `index.ts`, `public/index.php`, or DDL SQL scripts.
- **Do Not Remove Core Declarations**: Do not delete existing route registrations or database DDL tables.
- **Environment Isolation Compatibility**: When replacing fallback secrets, preserve test environment execution via `!getenv('APP_ENV')` or `getenv('APP_ENV') === 'testing'`.
- **No Scratch Files**: Never stage or commit `test_*.ts`, `test_*.js`, `test.cjs`, `fix_*.php`, or `test.js` files to git.
- **No Unresolved Conflict Markers**: Never stage or commit files containing Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`, `|||||||`). Always resolve conflicts cleanly before committing.

## Hallucinatory Task & Empty PR Directives
- **Zero-Diff Task Termination**: If the requested optimization, refactor, or fix is ALREADY natively present in the target branch, DO NOT create an empty pull request or commit an acknowledgment PR. Exit the task cleanly without opening a PR.
- **Stale Suggestion Guard**: Always verify the current code on `main`/`master` before planning changes. If no actionable diff is required, cancel task execution immediately.
