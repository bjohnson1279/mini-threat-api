## 2024-05-24 - Remove Hardcoded Secret
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded `JWT_SECRET_KEY` was found in `app/config.py` as a fallback value for an environment variable.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secrets in application code can be easily exposed via version control and can break multi-worker deployments (e.g., Gunicorn/Uvicorn) if dynamic defaults like `secrets.token_urlsafe()` are used.
**Prevention:** Always omit default values for sensitive configuration options in Pydantic BaseSettings to enforce configuration via environment variables, ensuring secrets are managed securely and explicitly.
